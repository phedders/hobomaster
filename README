Population of .gitmodules
-------------------------
	By default, the Rakefile will check that the .gitmodules file has entries for the relevant
	repos, then run "git-init" and "git-submodule update".

Use of this repo for pushing submodules upstream
------------------------------------------------
	If this hobomaster checkout is going to be used to push updates to github (or anywhere else)
	then the urls in .git/config will need to be updated (to use ssh etc). The urls should _not_
	be updated in .gitmodules since this is shared with everyone who pulls this repo.

How does this work?
-------------------
	The git-submodule system works by not only setting up 'remote' stanzas in .git/config of the
	master, it also stores in commits a record of the specific commit that is checked out in each
	submodule... so to get exactly the same environment all one has to do is commit in the source,
	clone and then "git-submodule init; git-submodule update". FAB. And so you can even track
	"release" versions by just tagging the master archive with its record of commits. Nice.
